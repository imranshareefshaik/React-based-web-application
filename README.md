## Common Issues and Fixes
### **Error: `package.json` Not Found**
- Ensure you're inside the correct project folder.
- Run:
  ```sh
  npm init -y
  ```
  Then reinstall dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
  

### **Error: `react-scripts` Not Found**
- Install it manually:
  ```sh
  npm install react-scripts --save
  ```

### **Error: `index.html` Not Found**
- Ensure there is a file at `public/index.html`.
- If missing, create one with the following content:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

## Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build/` folder with minified files ready for deployment.

## Deployment
To deploy the React application, use any of the following options:
- **GitHub Pages:**
  ```sh
  npm install --save gh-pages
  ```
  Add the following to `package.json`:
  ```json
  "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
  ```
  Then run:
  ```sh
  npm run deploy
  ```
- **Netlify:** Drag and drop the `build/` folder to Netlify’s dashboard.
- **Vercel:** Use the Vercel CLI (`vercel deploy`).
